<h1>Hi, I'm nevercaught! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
	<p>I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems. My interests include web development, data analysis, and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects and experimenting with new technologies.</p>
	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>Here are some of my recent projects that I'm proud of:</p>
	<h3>Project 1: Web App for Real Estate Analysis</h3>
	<p>This web application allows users to analyze real estate data from various sources and generate reports and insights. The app uses Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL on the backend and React on the frontend. I worked on this project as part of a team of three developers.</p>
	<h3>Project 2: Machine Learning Model for Predicting Stock Prices</h3>
	<p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model that predicts stock prices based on historical data. The model uses Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I trained the model on a large dataset and achieved an accuracy of 85%. The model is deployed as a RESTful API using Flask.</p>
